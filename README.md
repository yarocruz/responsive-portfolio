# Responsive Portfolio

This is the responsive version of the [barebones portoflio site](https://github.com/yarocruz/portfolio). The purpose of this mini project is to get familiar with responsive website design by using media queries and [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/).
